                        Our team started with three passionate individualsâ€”Dhaya, Digeesh, and Easwar. Dhaya Sir, known for his kindness and dedication, was the driving force behind the creation of our NPO. Over time, our team has grown, with representatives now present in every district of India, united in our mission to make a positive impact.
